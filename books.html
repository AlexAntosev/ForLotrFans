          <p class="text">Large print hardback edition of the first volume of J.R.R. Tolkien’s epic adventure, The Lord of the Rings, complete with fold-out map.</p>
          <p class="text">Sauron, the Dark Lord, has gathered to him all the Rings of Power – the means by which he intends to rule Middle-earth. All he lacks in his plans for dominion is the One Ring – the ring that rules them all – which has fallen into the hands of the hobbit, Bilbo Baggins.In a sleepy village in the Shire, young Frodo Baggins finds himself faced with an immense task, as his elderly cousin Bilbo entrusts the Ring to his care. Frodo must leave his home and make a perilous journey across Middle-earth to the Cracks of Doom, there to destroy the Ring and foil the Dark Lord in his evil purpose.Now available in large print and impossible to describe in a few words, JRR Tolkien’s great work of imaginative fiction has been labelled both a heroic romance and a classic fantasy fiction. By turns comic and homely, epic and diabolic, the narrative moves through countless changes of scene and character in an imaginary world which is totally convincing in its detail.</p>

          <p class="text">Large print hardback edition of the second volume of J.R.R. Tolkien’s epic adventure, The Lord of the Rings, complete with fold-out map.</p>
          <p class="text">This large print edition tells the story of Frodo and the Companions of the Ring, who have been beset by danger during their quest to prevent the Ruling Ring from falling into the hands of the Dark Lord by destroying it in the Cracks of Doom. They have lost the wizard, Gandalf, in the battle with an evil spirit in the Mines of Moria; and at the Falls of Rauros, Boromir, seduced by the power of the Ring, tried to seize it by force. While Frodo and Sam made their escape the rest of the company were attacked by Orcs.</p>
          <p class="text">Now they continue their journey alone down the great River Anduin – alone, that is, save for the mysterious creeping figure that follows wherever they go.</p>

Tolkien created a vast new mythology in an invented world which has proved timeless in its appeal.</p>
